## Hi there 👋

This is Maries.

I'm a passionate creator with 6+ years in Game Development & LLM Apps—mostly in the Java ecosystem, but equally curious about anything that helps players feel delight and teams move faster. 🤗 I love translating wild ideas into polished interactive moments and sharing what I learn along the way.

- 🧠 Architecting responsive gameplay systems with clean, observable code.
- 🎯 Shipping story-driven prototypes during rapid-fire hackathons and jams.
- 🤝 Pairing AI-assisted tooling with human creativity to unblock teammates.

## 🎮 GameJam Spotlight

**GameJam** is my creative playground. Every sprint is a 48-hour window to test bold mechanics, compose music snippets, and collaborate with artists, writers, and AI tinkerers. Highlights include:

- ⏱️ Lightning-fast ideation that keeps scope realistic without losing heart.
- 🧩 Cross-discipline co-creation sessions that blend art direction with narrative beats.
- 🛠️ Toolchains that let designers tweak parameters live while I stabilize builds.

Whether I'm mentoring a team or racing the deadline myself, GameJam keeps me sharp and inspires most of the experiments you see here.
